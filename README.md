# Dad Jokes App


## Introduction

The Dad Jokes App is a simple web application that brings humor and memories together. It combines classic dad jokes from a public API with a special twist -- it cycles through different pictures of me and my late father, making it memorable and personal. 

My father was an engineer who absolutely loved telling terrible jokes! Every time I open this app, it makes me smile. He is definitely an inspiration for not only my tech career, but my sense of humor!
