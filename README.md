# Dad Jokes App


## Introduction

The Dad Jokes App is a simple web application that brings humor and heartwarming memories together. It combines classic dad jokes from a public API with a special twistâ€”it cycles through different pictures of you and your late father, making it a touching and memorable experience.

This app is not just about laughter; it's a tribute to your father's memory, who was an engineer and the inspiration behind your own tech career. It's a way to cherish the moments and humor you shared with him while showcasing your skills as an engineer.
